# Bidirectional Visitor Counter using Arduino
Bidirectional visitor counter is a reliable circuit that takes over the
task of counting number of Persons/ Visitors in the Room very accurately.
When somebody enters into the Room then the Counter is Incremented by one.


 The total number of Persons inside the Room is displayed on the LIQUID
CRYSTAL display (LCD) module. The microcontroller does the above job it
receives the signals from the sensors, and this signals operated under the
control of software which is stored in ROM of arduino.


  It can be used to count the number of persons entering a hall in the up
mode at entrance gate. In the down mode, it can count the number of persons
leaving the hall by decrementing the count at exit gate. It can also be used at
gates of parking areas and other public places.


This circuit divided in three parts: sensor, controller and counter display.
The sensor would observe an interruption and provide an input to the
controller which would run the counter in up/down mode depending upon the
selector setting. The same count is displayed on a liquid crystal display
through the controller.


 This project we will create counter system for apply. The total number of
object is displayed on the LCD. The system is fully controlled by the
ARDUINO. It can also be used at gates of parking areas and other public
places.


 Wastage of electricity is one of the main problems which we are facing now-a-
days. In our home, school, colleges or industry we see that fan and lighting
point are kept on even if there are nobody in the room or area and passage.
This happens due to negligence or because we forgot to turn lights off or we
are in a hurry. To avoid all such situations this project called “Automatic room
light controller with visitor counter” is designed. This project has two
Modules, first one is known as “Digital Visitor counter” and second module is
known as “Automatic room light controller” .


 Main concept behind this project is known as “Visitor counter”
which measures the number of persons entering in any room like seminar hall,
conference room, hotel rooms. This function is implemented using IR sensor
module with arduino. Here Arduino receives the signals from the sensors, and
this signal is operated under the control of software which is stored in the
ROM
